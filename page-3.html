            The history of anime is long and complex. It all started over 100 years ago when Archduke Franz Ferdinand of
            Austria-Hungary is assassinated
            This event causes WW1, during which Hitler became very nationalistic, leading to his political career and
            becoming dictator of Germany. This,
            of course, causes WW2. Now, at this time Japan was becoming very imperialistic and allied with Germany.
            During their conquest of the pacific the
            Japanese bombed pearl harbour, bringing the Americans into the war against them. One of the final acts of
            the war was the dropping of nuclear weapons
            on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, leading to Japanese surrender and the American occupation
            of Japan. During this period the American
            culture mixed with Japanese culture. The Japanese people became infatuated with the American comics and
            cartoons, and went on to make their own versions
            the Japanese comics became what we now know as Manga, and the Japanese cartoons became known as Anime.
