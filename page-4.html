            A lot of memes have been created by anime in the West. One such example is the naruto run.
        </p>
        <p>
            The naruto run is a style of running, where the person runs bending forward and with their arms
            flailing behind them.
        </p>
        <p>
            People found this method of running very funny. Some people always thought that there were aliens in 
            Area 51. They decided to storm Area 51 to see if there were aliens there, whilst doing the Naruto run.
            Their attempt became viral and that is how the naruto run became a meme.
        </p>
        <p>
            The naruto run actually works when moving at very high speeds. This is because your body is a lot more
            aerodynamic and thus, there is less air resistence.
